Update Mods
Rebalance pack
	From user podank:
			Limit each mod to only needing things from itself, and TFC,
		instead of making players slog through many different mods for certain items
		"don't make me figure out how to make a Defense Turret in whatever MOD that is 
		before i can even shock a zombie with my wand.
		I think for instance that either Refined Iron needs to be toned down to Wrought Iron, 
		or converted to Steel, in the thaumcraft recipies. 
		not sure what to do for refined gold but same complaint."
			In P.S.: "the thermostatic harness. it had a bunch of stuff from other 
		mods in it--they weren't a problem in themselves, they were a nice multi step process. 
		the problem was needing refined iron to make the nuggets to make the transistor...
		so i am not suggesting we eliminate other mods stuff from every recipe, 
		but just dont make me have to go deep into some other mod to do stuff in another...
		except for TFC as the root of all mods..."
	From user Simmareth:
		"[disable sapling drops] for managing tree farming. Making the saplings an acquired item during the iron age by way of a recipe involving leaves or cuttings. Good way to reflect on the advances of agriculture during the iron age, in this case Arboriculture and the related forestry-based industries."
